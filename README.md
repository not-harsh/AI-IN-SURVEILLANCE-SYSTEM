AI in surveillance system
AI in surveillance systems uses AI techniques to enhance CCTV
cameras and monitoring equipment. It includes
object recognition, motion detection, and more. It aims to
improve efficiency and accuracy of monitoring and
automate tasks such as identifying potential security threats and
suspicious behavior. It reduces human operators
workload and makes surveillance systems more effective.
Platform:
The primary platform used for this project is Python.
Technologies Used:
Tinkter: A Python GUI toolkit used for building user interfaces to
interact with the surveillance system effectively.
PyMySQL: A Python library for interfacing with MySQL databases,
used to store and manage surveillance data efficiently.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Utilized for image processing
tasks, enabling the manipulation and analysis of visual data.
OpenCV2: An open-source computer vision library employed for
tasks like object recognition, motion detection, and image
analysis.
coco.names: A pre-trained model containing a comprehensive
set of object categories used in object recognition tasks.
Frozen Inference Graph: A trained deep learning model used in
real-time object detection and recognition.
hashlib: A Python library used for generating and verifying hash
values, ensuring data integrity and security.
Outcome:
The "AI in Surveillance System" project successfully integrates AI
techniques and advanced technologies to achieve enhanced
surveillance efficiency, automated threat detection, reduced
human operator workload, increased security effectiveness, and
ensured data integrity and security. By leveraging AI algorithms
and cutting-edge tools, the system significantly improves
monitoring operations, automatically identifies potential security
threats, relieves human operators from constant monitoring, and
enhances the overall reliability and effectiveness of surveillance
systems.
